# myNvim config

Welcome, I'm Cris, this is my current nvim configuratio for my workspace. In order tobe able of using the same configuration is as simple to clone the git into your ~/.config/nvim.

```console
git clone https://github.com/Cristian104/myNvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
After this, just cd into your nvim folder
```console
cd ~/.config/nvim
```

And run the init.lua with nvim
```console
nvim init.lua
```

Everything will get installed with Packer.
